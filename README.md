# Minesweeper
A C++ implementation of Minesweeper, a game where the objective is to flag all the mines on a field without touching them.<br>
If you encounter any bugs â€“ first of all, congratulations, I don't know how you did that, and second of all, report them so I *maybe* fix them.

## Objective
- Locate all 12 mines by planting flags on them
- Avoid setting the mines off
- Use the numbers on the tiles to see how many mines are nearby

## Controls
- Arrowkeys to move, selected tiles are shaded blue
- Enter to reveal tile, revealed tiles are unshaded
- Spacebar to flag (limit 12 flags), flags are yellow
- Q to quit
- R to restart
